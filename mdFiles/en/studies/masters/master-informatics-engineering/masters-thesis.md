The Master's Thesis (TFM) of the Master in Informatics Engineering has 30 ECTS
credits and can be done in the Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona, in a
company (national or international) or in another university (national or
international).

The FIB has a large number of [agreements with
companies](en\\companies\\industrial-practices.md) and [foreign
universities](en\\mobility.md) to give students the possibility of completing
the Master's Thesis in one of these modalities.

### Academic Regulations

[Master's Thesis
regulations](sites\\fib\\files\\documents\\estudis\\normativa-tfe-fib-
en.pdf.md)

**What you should do and when** :

__Registration: when you have passed a minimum of 30 ECTS credits for
compulsory subjects.

__Enrolment: when you have passed a minimum of 30 ECTS credits for compulsory
subjects.

__You can check the[6 steps to make your TFG / TFM a
success](en\\estudiants\\6-passos-que-teu-tfg\\tfm-sigui-exit.md) _._

## Procedure for the Master's Thesis

From an academic point of view, any successful TFM requires fluent
communication with your supervisor / tutor with periodic meetings. From an
administrative point of view, most of the procedure is performed via
[Racó](index.md), from where you will be guided throughout the process. This
document highlights the main administrative steps of the TFM but it is not
meant replace the need to read the master’s thesis regulations.

__During the progress milestone is the only moment where it is possible to
update your master thesis title and description.

### **1\. TFM registration**

Registering the TFM is necessary to inform the faculty you agreed on a master
thesis topic and you will start working on it.

__**Importantly** , you cannot start working on your thesis until you meet the
following requirements and successfully register it:

  * Students may register for the master’s thesis when they have passed the minimum of credits stated in the regulation.
  * Registration needs to happen one semester before enrolment.

You must register your TFM via [Racó](index.md), in a new tab that appears to
students meeting the requirements described above. The inscription must be
accepted by the TFM supervisor or tutor.

__**Registration period**

1st semester: Thursday 05 September 2024 to Saturday 01 February 2025 - 23:59  
2nd semester: Monday 10 February 2025 to Friday 11 July 2025 - 23:59

### **2\. TFM enrolment**

You can enrol in the TFM when you have passed the minimum of credits stated in
the regulation.

If you registered your TFM in the previous semester, during your enrolment, a
new course will appear to enrol the TFM.

__**Enrolment period**

2nd semester (registrations done during the 1st semester of 2024-2025 academic
year): 3 February 2025  
1st semester (registrations done during the 2nd semester of 2024-2025 academic
year): TBC

### **3\. Defence period**

At this point you must choose when to defend your thesis at [Racó](index.md).
For each enrolment there are two defence periods:

**Ordinary period**

TFM enrolled in the 1st semester: Monday 20 January 2025 to Friday 24 January
2025  
TFM enrolled in the 2nd semester: Wednesday 25 June 2025 to Tuesday 01 July
2025

**Extraordinary period**

TFM enrolled in the 1st semester: Monday 12 May 2025 to Friday 16 May 2025  
TFM enrolled in the 2nd semester: Monday 21 October 2024 to Friday 25 October
2024

The extraordinary defence period requires paying the academic taxes (not the
credits).

**__Important** : you must discuss with your supervisor / tutor a feasible and
reasonable plan. Therefore, you must choose the defence period when you are
certain about meeting the targeted period. If the deadline comes and you are
experiencing problems to meet the ordinary defence period you are advised to
choose the extraordinary defence period.

### **4\. TFM progress review milestone**

This milestone is meant to reflect the status of your TFM and the chances to
properly defend your thesis on time. Without conducting this milestone on time
you will not be allowed to defend (regardless of the defence period chosen).

Before the deadline set in Racó, you must upload to [Racó ](index.md)a
document, agreed with the supervisor or tutor, with the following sections:

  * Fulfillment of the work plan and objectives
  * Adjustments made and justification for these changes
  * Work plan for completing the master’s thesis

The supervisor / tutor must accept the document and assess. The assessment
includes the sections in the specific regulations of the degree or, failing
that, the following aspects:

  * Autonomy in carrying out the thesis work
  * Autonomy in writing the thesis
  * The work plan developed and work carried out to date
  * Communication with the thesis supervisor or tutor

This assessment can be modified in the final milestone.

**Deadline for the follow up meeting**

**Ordinary period**

TFM enrolled in the 1st semester: Thursday 12 December 2024 - 13:00  
TFM enrolled in the 2nd semester: Thursday 22 May 2025 - 13:00

**Extraordinary period**

TFM enrolled in the 1st semester: Thursday 03 April 2025 - 13:00  
TFM enrolled in the 2nd semester: Thursday 19 September 2024 - 13:00

**__** Be aware that by the progress review deadline your supervisor / tutor
must have accepted and assessed your progress.

### **5\. TFM report**

After completing the progress review milestone, the next step is to upload the
master’s thesis final report via [Racó](index.md).  
There is a strict deadline to submit the final report **one week before your
defence** (check [Racó](index.md) to know the deadline).

**__Importantly,** your supervisor / tutor must accept the master’s thesis
report before the set deadline. Failing to meet the deadline will result in
your automatic defence withdrawal.  
It is mandatory to use the cover (front page) automatically generated by
[Racó](index.md) in your final report. Just use the service available in
[Racó](index.md) to generate it with your TFM metadata.

The report is free format. It is compulsory to include the standard TFM cover
page (which students can generate themselves using the mechanisms established
by the FIB), a summary of the work (or abstract) and include an analysis of
sustainability and ethical implications according to the agreement of the
[Governing Council of 07-2023](ca\\consell-de-govern\\consell-de-
govern\\sessio-07-2023-del-consell-de-govern\\comissio-docencia-i-politica-
academica-pendent-celebracio\\informacio-de-la-guia-per-incorporar-lanalisi-
de-sostenibilitat-i-implicacions-etiques-en-els-tfe\\informacio-de-la-guia-
per-incorporar-lanalisi-de-sostenibilitat-i-implicacions-etiques-en-els-
tfe\\@@display-
file\\visiblefile\\Guia%20Informe%20Sostenibilitat%20TFG_TFM_versi%C3%B3%20UPC.pdf.md).

As a guideline, it is recommended that the report should include the following
sections:

  * Cover page
  * Summary
  * Index
  * Introduction, motivation and objectives
  * State of the art
  * Specification and design of the solution
  * Development of the proposal/technique/work that has been carried out
  * Experimentation and evaluation of the proposal/technique/work
  * Sustainability analysis and ethical implications
  * Conclusions
  * List of references used
  * Annexes with complementary information

**MEI students**

In addition, it is mandatory to include a section on project management and
work planning. The following structure is recommended:

  * Background analysis
  * Planning
  * Sustainability report
  * Feasibility, overall economic analysis and comparison with other alternatives
  * Risk assessment

**MDS students**

The mandatory report on sustainability and ethical implications is carried out
through the [gender competence](en\\studies\\masters\\master-data-
science\\masters-thesis\\gender-competency.md) associated with the Master's
thesis.

### **6\. TFM defence**

The student must defend the thesis in a public session in front of an
evaluation committee. The evaluation committee shall be designated at least
fifteen days before the date chosen to defend the TFM. In the following days
after being appointed, the commission will communicate the precise date and
place for the defence. The evaluation committee will have access to the
progress review and final reports. The thesis evaluation is a numeric mark
between 0 and 10.

Additionally, to promote transparency, the commission will provide a [rubric-
based](en\\studies\\masters\\master-informatics-engineering\\masters-
thesis.md) assessment supporting the evaluation emitted.

#### [Rubric-based](en\\studies\\masters\\master-informatics-
engineering\\masters-thesis.md)

Each item will be assessed as unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, very good,
and excellent.
