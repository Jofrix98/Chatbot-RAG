## Access in case of changing university and/or changing Spanish official
university studies

Access due to changing university and/or changing Spanish official university
studies implies in all cases the closure of the initial academic record.
Consequently, students who have graduated or are eligible to obtain the
degree, as well as those who intend to pursue simultaneous studies or a double
degree program, cannot access through this route under any circumstances.

### Who can request access to UPC studies?

Students who want to change university and/or Spanish official university
studies can apply for direct admission to a faculty or school at UPC, or to a

A student declared unfit under sections 5.4 and 5.5 of the UPC Bachelor's Degree Retention Regulations (NAGRAMA) is considered affected for the following two years after their disaffiliation. If they have been disaffiliated under section 5.8, they are considered affected for the disaffiliation period determined by the rector.

If these requirements are not met, the student should request the access
through the pre-enrollment process.

The applications will be prioritized in accordance with the following
criteria:

  * Studies that belong to the same branch of knowledge.
  * Weighting of students' academic records
  * Access grade for university studies
