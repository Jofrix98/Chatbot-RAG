Information systems use information technologies to provide people with the
information they need, giving vital support to business operations, management
and decision-making. Companies and other organisations use information systems
as strategic tools for innovating, competing and achieving their goals in a
globalised market. Information systems comprise people, processes, data and
technology and extend beyond traditional organisational boundaries to
establish more efficient relationships with suppliers, distributors and
customers.  
  
Students who choose to specialise in Information Systems will acquire an
understanding of the operational processes and management tasks carried out in
organisational settings. They will learn about the different tools for
constructing an information system, the recent process of standardisation of
many of these tools and the range of possible applications, which include
customer relations management, supply chain management, e-commerce, internal
process management, business intelligence, knowledge management and business
decision support.  
  
Upon completion of the course, students will be able to analyse the management
requirements of an organisation and design specific technological solutions,
adapting and integrating the most suitable tools at their disposal. They will
also be able to identify process improvement opportunities and implement
innovative solutions that enable organisations to harness their information
systems for strategic competitiveness.

## Career options

Graduates with specialised training in Information Systems can follow a wide
range of career paths, in addition to teaching and research. Common options
include the following:  
  
**Management roles**

  * Information systems managers participate in strategic decisions related to information systems, facilitate communication between the technology division and the business and support divisions, oversee the implementation of new applications and the integration of technology infrastructure and manage the budget and human resources of the information systems division.
  * IT managers devise the company systems plan, organise the IT department (hardware, software and human resources), coordinate with other departments and liaise with suppliers. IT managers usually report to information systems management.
  * E-business managers are responsible for e-business strategy, planning, execution and control.

**Middle-management and technical roles**

  * Business analysts analyse and identify organisational requirements and design business process improvement (BPI) plans and business process reengineering (BPR) plans, which often require changes to existing information systems. Business analysts act as intermediaries between the stakeholders in a solution and the technical team responsible for its design and implementation.
  * Information systems consultants analyse the operational and/or technical requirements of an organisation, oversee the parameterisation and implementation of information systems and manage user training programmes. They work with a range of systems including business information systems (ERP, CRM, SCM, etc.), decision support systems (DSS), business intelligence (BI) systems and content management systems (CMS).
  * Information systems auditors assess compliance with regulatory and procedural standards for information systems, ensure the correct implementation of management quality practices (COBIT, ITIL), control compliance with applicable legislation on ICTs and advise management on the improvement and internal control of information systems.
  * Customer support directors are responsible for the services offered in customer support centres, the management and control of supplier contracts, and the quality budget and cost of these services.
  * Database administrators are responsible for the logical and physical design of organisational databases and for guaranteeing recoverability, integrity, security, availability and performance
