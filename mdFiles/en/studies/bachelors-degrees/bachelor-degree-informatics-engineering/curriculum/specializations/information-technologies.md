A graduate specialist in Information Technology (IT) will know the necessary
technologies, both hardware and software, to store, retrieve, transmit and
manipulate data. This means that an IT specialist has a good technical and
practical knowledge in managing the technological infrastructure which treats
the information and the development of systems. An engineer of IT specializes
in integrating information technologies rather than the information itself and
has knowledge of hardware, operating systems, programming languages,
communication protocols, distributed systems and architectures of systems.

Examples of these concepts include aspects as diverse as can be the design of
Internet Service Providers (ISP) and/or IT departments, design of Data
Processing Centres (CPD), Big Data infrastructures, administration and design
of operating systems, computer security applied to Internet infrastructures
and to applications, design of distributed systems and distributed
applications, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), Cloud Computing, Grid Computing and Mobile
Computing, Web Services, exchange of multimedia content (audio, video), social
networks, mobile applications, Internet of things.

  
Have a look at the briefing of this specialisation:

## Career options

Many different professional positions, both in private companies and in public
administration, including consultant that design large infrastructures such as
ISP or CPD, telecom operators, administration and management of IT
departments, integration and maintenance of services and applications in
corporate environments, managers of Big Data infrastructures, designers of
mobile applications, designers of distributed applications, Web Service
developers, experts in computer security, architects of Internet
infrastructures and data networks, Internet of things developers and
designers, etc.

## Requisites between subjects

#### [Prerequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\information-
technologies.md)

If a subject A is prerequisite of another subject B, it means that to be able
to register B is necessary to have passed the subject A.

#### [Corequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\information-
technologies.md)

If a subject A is corequisite of another subject B, it means that to be able
to register B is necessary to have passed or to be register in the subject A.

#### [Precorequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\information-
technologies.md)

If a subject A is precorequisite of another subject B, it means that to be
able to register B it is necessary to be registered (a quadrimester before at
least) subject A. But, in case of havig a list of precorequits (A
precorequsite of B, and B precorequisite of C), it won't be posible to
register subject C until subject A has not been passed.

#### [Orequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-
engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\information-technologies.md)

If two subjects A and B are orequisite of subject C, it means that to register
subject C it is necessary to have passed either subject A or subject B.

#### [Incompatible](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
