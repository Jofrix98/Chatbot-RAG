## Career options

Graduates with specialised training in Computing possess the knowledge and
skills to design complex computer systems that comply with critical
efficiency, reliability and security requirements, applicable to areas such as
flight scheduling, the verification of ABS braking systems or the development
of person-machine interfaces for next-generation mobile telephones. Social
responsibility places greater focus on energy efficiency and economic
efficiency, and IT professionals capable of working within these parameters
are highly valued in a wide range of fields, including robotics and industrial
process optimisation, financial product development and forecasting, public
infrastructure planning, scientific experimentation and image processing in
biomedical research centres, and video game and web application programming.  
  
The growing need for innovation has increased the demand for professionals
with the training and scientific rigour to join multidisciplinary teams of
engineers, scientists or economists. Computing specialists are highly valued
for their ability to innovate and to identify and guarantee the critical
requirements of complex computer systems, which makes them ideal candidates to
lead international companies at the forefront of this change in the IT
industry.

least) subject A. But, in case of havig a list of precorequits (A
precorequsite of B, and B precorequisite of C), it won't be posible to
register subject C until subject A has not been passed.
