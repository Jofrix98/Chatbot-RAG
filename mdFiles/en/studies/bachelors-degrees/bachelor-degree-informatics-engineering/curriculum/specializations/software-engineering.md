This specialisation provides students with the skills to participate in
projects for the design, maintenance and evaluation of different software
systems and services and to carry out the tasks corresponding to different
professional roles, including project director, analyst, domain expert,
requirements engineer, software architect and database administrator. Students
will learn to carry out projects of arbitrary complexity (for example,
involving teams from different countries), of critical importance (for
example, involving potential risk to human life in the event of faulty
operation) and of different technical characteristics (for example, involving
service-based systems, web systems, real-time systems, embedded systems or
business systems). As a differentiating feature, students will also learn to
ensure that these projects comply with the main quality standards applied in
the software industry and to integrate social considerations such as
sustainability, resource optimisation and confidentiality.

## Career options

Software is an important element in IT systems and has become the fulcrum of
IT services for individuals and organisations, leading to widespread use of
the term “software as a service”. The service sector is the mainstay of
developed economies and the area that has shown the greatest economic growth
in recent years, and the concept of services is now largely inseparable from
the software upon which these services are built.  
  
Informatics engineers with specialised training in Software Engineering can
pursue a wide range of careers, including skilled and management positions in
the following areas:

  * Development of software services and systems, working with the latest software engineering methods, techniques and tools.
  * Requirements engineering, software architecture, database administration, and any other area related to informatics.
  * Software engineering reviewing and auditing for organisations, and the design and implementation of management and quality improvement plans.
