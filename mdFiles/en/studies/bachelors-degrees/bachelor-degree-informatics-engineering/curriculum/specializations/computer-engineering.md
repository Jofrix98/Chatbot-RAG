## Career options

Graduates with specialised training in Computer Engineering have the knowledge
and skills to apply basic concepts and techniques for the design of individual
processors and multiprocessor systems and to obtain the maximum performance
from these systems for running standard applications. They are also able to
implement a range of systems, including embedded systems, portable systems,
interfaces, robotics systems and any other type of system that interacts with
its environment and is controlled by real-time computer architecture. The
ability to implement computer technology in an effective and efficient manner
makes graduates suitable for a wide range of professional areas, including
processor design, application programming, the design and implementation of
computer systems and facilities for specific services, and the design of
embedded systems, printers and multimedia devices.

## Requisites between subjects

#### [Prerequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\computer-engineering.md)

If a subject A is prerequisite of another subject B, it means that to be able
to register B is necessary to have passed the subject A.

#### [Corequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\computer-engineering.md)

If a subject A is corequisite of another subject B, it means that to be able
to register B is necessary to have passed or to be register in the subject A.

#### [Precorequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\computer-engineering.md)

If a subject A is precorequisite of another subject B, it means that to be
able to register B it is necessary to be registered (a quadrimester before at
least) subject A. But, in case of havig a list of precorequits (A
precorequsite of B, and B precorequisite of C), it won't be posible to
register subject C until subject A has not been passed.

#### [Orequisite](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-
engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\computer-engineering.md)

If two subjects A and B are orequisite of subject C, it means that to register
subject C it is necessary to have passed either subject A or subject B.

#### [Incompatible](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-
informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\specializations\\computer-engineering.md)

If a subject A is incompatible with another subject B, it means that you are
not able to register A if you have passed the subject B.
