## Reassessment course 2024-2025 autumn semester

### What do we mean by reassessment?

Reassessments are the second chance to overcome specific subjects within the
initial stage of GEI. They include active participation in an intensive course
lasting 12 teaching hours, as well as passing an exam on the subject. It is
estimated that a successful reassessment requires 50 students’ working hours,
including lectures and evaluation. Places for reassessments are limited, are
some requirements for students apply.

In the actual situation, we've decided that reassessment classes will be
presencial, keeping the oficial protection measures. Usage of mask will be
compulsory. This has led to a change in the dates of some subject's
reassessment.

### Subjects with reassessment

There will be a reassessment of the subjects:

  * FM: [Fundamentals of Mathematics](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\syllabus\\FM.md)
  * IC: [Introduction to Computers](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\syllabus\\IC.md)
  * PRO1: [Programming I](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\syllabus\\PRO1.md)
  * EC: [Computer Organization](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\syllabus\\EC.md)
  * M1: [Mathematics I](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\syllabus\\M1.md)
  * PRO2: [Programming II](en\\studies\\bachelors-degrees\\bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering\\curriculum\\syllabus\\PRO2.md)

Every student can enrol to one reassessment per semester only.

### Requirements to be eligible for reassessment

To be eligible for the reassessment of a subject you need to be enrolled to
the corresponding subject and have obtained a final mark between 3.5 and 4.9.
In addition, there are specific requisites for some subjects. Consult them,
please, at the educational guide.

### Dates

The intensive courses consist of 2 diary hours of face-to-face classes in the
morning schedule **from 24 to 31 January 2025**. The exams will take place on
Monday 3 February in the morning.

### Requirements to be evaluated of the intensive course

To be evaluated of the intensive course it is compulsory:

  * To attend all classes.
  * To complete exercises and activities proposed by the Professor in charge of the course.

### Preregistration and admission

Pre-registration will take place:

  * **Thursday 23 January 2025,** from 10 am to 2 pm through the [Racó](index.md).

If the number of applicants exceeds the number of places, priority will be
given to students with higher qualifications on the subject. Every student can
take one intensive course per semester only. When preregistering, students
should apply for a maximum of two subjects, sorted by priority.
Preregistration implies the commitment to attend the course in case of being
admitted. Admission and no attendance to the course involves not being
admitted in future editions. The list of admissions will be published on the
same day of the pre-registration.

### Evaluation

The result of the evaluation of the intensive course will be _apt_ or _unfit_.
The final qualification of the subject will be:

  * Definitive qualification=5 if the qualification of the intensive is _Apt_
  * Definitive qualification= Qualification of the subject if the qualification of the intensive is _unfit_

Where _qualification of the subject_ is the qualification obtained before
reassessment.
