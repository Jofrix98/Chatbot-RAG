Description

A common trait of current computing systems is that their internal data
communication has become a fundamental bottleneck. Traditional interconnects
are insufficient and threatening to halt progress unless fast and versatile
communication alternatives are developed.

In the NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat, www.n3cat.upc.edu), we are
investigating the use of ultra-short range wireless communications an
alternative to current interconnects. In our EU project EWiC, we aim to
emulate chip-to-chip wireless communications within a computer. For that, we
will emulate the behavior of a multi-chip CPU with FPGAs, and connect them
wirelessly using Software-Defined Radios (SDR).

N3Cat is looking for students wanting to acquire hands-on experience in the
programming and interconnection of FPGAs, and to participate in a cutting-edge
project to interconnect these FPGAs wirelessly. In more detail, the objectives
of the thesis are:

\- To help establishing the emulator and be able to simulate its behavior.  
\- To work in the implementation of adequate communication protocols for the
integration of wireless interconnects in the emulated multi-FPGA system.  
\- To assess the performance of the system via measurement campaigns.  
  

Minimum requirements

Effects of mixed-precision in vectorised computational kernels

Specializations

Computing

Summary

_Many numerical methods discretise the temporal dimension through a time-
stepping loop. In such methods, partial differential equations (PDEs) are
approximated at each spatial coordinate where stencil computations take place.
This project consists of studying the effects of mixed-precision in some
computational kernels derived from a system of PDEs. The ultimate goal is to
improve their performance and assess their numerical precision._

Description

This Bachelor Thesis will take place at the Departament d'Arquitectura de
Computadors (DAC) in collaboration with the STAR group at the Barcelona
Supercomputing Center (BSC).

The System Tools and Advanced Runtimes (STAR) group at BSC focuses on research
crossing multiple software layers from OS, runtimes, and low-level APIs, to
programming models, tools, and applications. We run traditional HPC, AI, and
Data Analytics applications on massively parallel HPC and Cloud platforms.

Arithmetic operations derived from stencils calculations often benefit from
compiler optimisations and automatic vectorisation in the cases where the
compiler has enough information and the data structures are adequately aligned
and traversed. While classical applications rely on double precision
arithmetic operations with 64-bit floating-point precision, CPU manufacturers
have recently begun introducing native hardware support down to 16-bit
precision.

The student will be tasked to adapt single-precision computational kernels of
a variety of applications including, for example, the N-body problem, the heat
equation, and some computational stencil used in computational fluid dynamics
problems to their mixed-precision counterparts. Next, he or she will vectorise
the kernels with the aid of OpenMP pragma directives and identify other
optimisation opportunities like loop unrolling or cache blocking. Finally, the
student will asses the effects of mixed-precision and, in particular, any
potential accuracy losses.

The student will have the support from researchers within the STAR group,
which will provide them guidance throughout the duration of the thesis. The
GTP models will be evaluated using the computational resources of our group.

Minimum requirements

Basic knowledge of C/C++ and OpenMP.

Description

Recent advancements in nanotechnology have enabled the development of means
for sensing and wireless communications with unprecedented miniaturization and
capabilities, to the point that they can be introduced into the
gastrointestinal tract inside a pill or into the bloodstream in the form of
passively flowing nanomachines.

This opens the door to the idea of intra-body communication networks, this is,
a swarm of nanosensors inside the human body that use communications to
coordinate their actions to sense and localize specific events (lack of
oxygen, biomarkers, etc). This can lead to the development of applications
such as continuous monitoring of diabetes, detection and localization of
cancer micro-tumors, or early detection of blood clots. These possibilities
are currently investigated by our team at the N3Cat (www.n3cat.upc.edu).

In this context, We are looking for excellent and self-motivated individuals
who are eager to develop ideas that will have a positive societal or socio-
economic impact. In particular, the students will work on ONE of the following
areas:

  * Developing means of zero-power communications between nanosensors inside the human body.
  * Designing protocols for communications from nanomachines inside the human body and implants or antennas in the skin surface.
  * Studying mobility inside the gastrointestinal tract and human bloodstream towards creating mobility models for accurate simulation of intra-body communications.
  * Dimensioning the system (inferring the required nanomachine density) to achieve a particular sensing goal/application.
  * Developing AI schemes for the localization of events inside of the human body.

Minimum requirements

Students wanting to apply are required to have a notable student record.
Moreover, candidates are expected to be:  
\- Highly motivated and self-sufficient,  
\- Willing to learn, pay attention to detail,  
\- With a good level of English (both oral and written).

Description

Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important challenge for all
companies and individuals alike. While big names used to be the main targets
in the past, as people's lives move online, anyone is nowadays a potential
target for any kind of cyber-attack, ranging from phishing to ransomware or
serious privacy issues. In order to fight against those ever-evolving threats,
Machine Learning is increasingly being used behind the scenes to design better
systems that are able of self-learning to boost detection rates and boost
overall resilience to unknown attacks. As AI-based solutions penetrate
products across the industry, a new kind of threat that is often overlooked is
becoming more and more prominent and dangerous: adversarial machine learning
(AML).  
  
AML focuses on designing specific inputs to deceive a previously trained
Machine Learning models into misclassifying them for a specific purpose. One
of the main flaws of any state-of-the-art Machine Learning or Deep Learning
algorithms is that they assume that the nature of the data they receive is
systematically benign, which is generally the case but does not hold true when
an adversarial input is received. The motivation behind altering a ML model
into thinking that, for example, a new sample is benign when in fact is
malicious can range from pure research to more serious real-life issues such
as an autonomous car wrongly classifying a stop sign (and thus provoking a
fatal accident) or a wrongly diagnosed disease because of a slightly
manipulated magnetic resonance image.  
  
This problem is no exception for Cybersecurity where companies wrongly assume
that once the last AI-based product is deployed in their network, their
employees are safe...

Minimum requirements

We are particularly interested in candidates with minimal AI/ML background.
Previous experience in Cybersecurity will be also highly valued.

Gradient descend based RBM learning [1] is a computationally expensive
procedure that requires the computation of a probability normalization
constant (called the Partition function) that involves the computation of an
exponentially large number of terms. In order to bypass that, different
approximations exist, the most celebrated one being the Annealed Importance
Sampling algorithm [2], that can be parallelized in one of its dimensions.

The goal of this project ir to implement the Annealed Importance Sampling for
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using python/CUDA, and compare the
performance against a standard CPU implementation.

Description

Computing systems are ubiquitous in our daily life and have transformed the
way we learn, work, or communicate with each other, to the point that progress
is intimately tied to the improvements brought by new generations of the
processors that lie at the heart of these systems.

A common trait of current computing systems is that their internal data
communication has become a fundamental bottleneck. Traditional interconnects
are insufficient and threatening to halt progress unless fast and versatile
communication alternatives are developed.

In the NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat, www.n3cat.upc.edu), we
envisage a revolution in computer architecture enabled by the use of wireless
communications (and other unconventional interconnect technologies) inside
computer chips, both classical and quantum. Of course, this vision comes with
its own set of challenges since we need to figure out the best way to
architect these systems with the new capabilities of the interconnects. In
this direction, the candidate will work on one of the following areas:

  * Analysis of the communications workload in nowadays computer chips and development of network-on-chip architectures to serve such traffic optimally.
  * Development of chiplet-based architectures in the classical domain in cache-coherent based systems, delving into the cache coherence protocol and the interface with the wireless interconnect.
  * Development of a supercomputer-in-a-package, a chiplet-based architecture based on message passing, delving into how to speed up the MPI primitives with wireless communications.
  * Study of scalable quantum computing systems enabled by wireless classical communication across the chips of the quantum computer and inside a cryogenic refrigerator.
