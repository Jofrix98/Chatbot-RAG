Understanding Emergence in Large Language Models

Resumen

_In this thesis, the focus is on understanding emergence in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Emergence refers to complex behaviors that arise from
interactions among individual components, even when those components lack
those behaviors individually. LLMs exhibit surprising linguistic abilities
beyond their constituent words or tokens. Assembly Theory (AT) provides a
framework for quantifying complexity without altering fundamental physical
laws. By applying AT to LLMs, this research aims to uncover how emergent
properties emerge from the interplay of simple components._

What is Emergence? Emergence refers to the phenomenon where a complex system
exhibits properties or behaviors that its individual components do not possess
in isolation. These emergent features arise only when the components interact
within a broader context. In philosophy, science, and art, emergence plays a
pivotal role in theories related to integrative levels and complex systems.
For example, life, as studied in biology, emerges from the underlying
chemistry and physics of biological processes.

Emergence in Large Language Models Recent research has highlighted emergent
behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, such as GPT-3, exhibit
surprising capabilities beyond their individual components (words or tokens).
The interactions between countless parameters give rise to emergent linguistic
abilities, including natural language understanding, generation, and context-
based reasoning. For further details, refer to
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682

What is Assembly Theory (AT)? Assembly Theory (AT) provides a novel framework
for quantifying complexity without altering fundamental physical laws. Unlike
traditional point-particle models, AT defines objects based on their potential
formation histories. These "objects" can exhibit evidence of selection within
well-defined boundaries. AT allows us to explore emergent properties by
considering how components assemble into coherent entities, shedding light on
the intricate dynamics of complex systems. See this paper for further
information: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06600-9

Research Goals: This thesis aims to apply Assembly Theory to understand
emergence in Large Language Models. We will test AT in this particular set
emergence problem.

Descripción

Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important challenge for all
companies and individuals alike. While big names used to be the main targets
in the past, as people's lives move online, anyone is nowadays a potential
target for any kind of cyber-attack, ranging from phishing to ransomware or
serious privacy issues. In order to fight against those ever-evolving threats,
Machine Learning is increasingly being used behind the scenes to design better
systems that are able of self-learning to boost detection rates and boost
overall resilience to unknown attacks. As AI-based solutions penetrate
products across the industry, a new kind of threat that is often overlooked is
becoming more and more prominent and dangerous: adversarial machine learning
(AML).  
  
AML focuses on designing specific inputs to deceive a previously trained
Machine Learning models into misclassifying them for a specific purpose. One
of the main flaws of any state-of-the-art Machine Learning or Deep Learning
algorithms is that they assume that the nature of the data they receive is
systematically benign, which is generally the case but does not hold true when
an adversarial input is received. The motivation behind altering a ML model
into thinking that, for example, a new sample is benign when in fact is
malicious can range from pure research to more serious real-life issues such
as an autonomous car wrongly classifying a stop sign (and thus provoking a
fatal accident) or a wrongly diagnosed disease because of a slightly
manipulated magnetic resonance image.  
  
This problem is no exception for Cybersecurity where companies wrongly assume
that once the last AI-based product is deployed in their network, their
employees are safe...

Requisitos mínimos

We are particularly interested in candidates with minimal AI/ML background.
Previous experience in Cybersecurity will be also highly valued.

Descripción

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging
technique that measures changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated
hemoglobin (HbR) in the cerebral cortex. Due to its portability and low cost,
fNIRS has been used in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications,
characterizing hemodynamic responses to varying stimuli, and investigating
auditory and visual-spatial attention during Complex Scene Analysis (CSA). In
this project, we want to design and implement an fNIRS study with a goal of
studying the impact of neural and BCI outcomes to improving the training of
LAI models' attention mechanism (e.g., Transformer attention) during reading
comprehension tasks (e.g., the participants will be judging the quality of
generated text). We want to demonstrate experimentally that augmenting a model
with fNIRS data carries neural activity features complementing the information
captured by the model and demonstrate that it improves the models'
performance. To this end, we will have to collect data from participants and
test how different Transformer models benefit from different types of fNIRS
attention masks.

The candidate will:

  * Carry out controlled studies and collect data from a number of participants.
  * Try different approaches to incorporating fNIRS signal in the training process of DL/LLM models and compare against baselines/experiments (these should be replicated).
  * Carry out ablation studies, personalisation techniques, error analyses, etc.
  * Contribute to authoring a scientific article

Requisitos mínimos

Coding skills in Python  
Familiarity with fNIRS technologies, e.g., Cortivision, Artinis (desirable,
not obligatory)  
Experience with controlled experimentation methods for data acquisition
(desirable, not obligatory)  
Experience in ML/DL techniques

Eye movement features are considered to be direct signals reflecting human
attention distribution with a low cost to obtain, inspiring researchers to
augment language models with eye-tracking (ET) data. In this project, we want
to investigate how to operationalise eye tracking (ET) features, such as first
fixation duration (FFD) and total reading time (TRT), as the cognitive signals
to augment LAI models' attention mechanism (e.g., Transformer attention)
during training. We want to demonstrate experimentally that augmenting a model
with ET data carries linguistic features complementing the information
captured by the model and demonstrate that it improves the models'
performance. To this end, we will have to collect data from participants and
test how different Transformer models benefit from different types of ET
attention masks.

The candidate will:

  * Carry out controlled studies and collect data from a number of participants.
  * Try different approaches to incorporating gaze features in the training process of DL/LLM models and compare against baselines/experiments (these should be replicated).
  * Carry out ablation studies, personalisation techniques, error analyses, etc.
  * Contribute to authoring a scientific article

Descripción

Recent advancements in nanotechnology have enabled the development of means
for sensing and wireless communications with unprecedented miniaturization and
capabilities, to the point that they can be introduced into the
gastrointestinal tract inside a pill or into the bloodstream in the form of
passively flowing nanomachines.

This opens the door to the idea of intra-body communication networks, this is,
a swarm of nanosensors inside the human body that use communications to
coordinate their actions to sense and localize specific events (lack of
oxygen, biomarkers, etc). This can lead to the development of applications
such as continuous monitoring of diabetes, detection and localization of
cancer micro-tumors, or early detection of blood clots. These possibilities
are currently investigated by our team at the N3Cat (www.n3cat.upc.edu).

In this context, we are looking for excellent and self-motivated individuals
who are eager to work on developing AI schemes (based on graph neural networks
or multi-agent RL) for the detection and localization of events inside of the
human body. Data will be gathered with an in-house simulator that integrates
mobility models (BloodVoyagerS) and communication models (TeraSim).

Requisitos mínimos

Students wanting to apply are required to have a notable student record.
Moreover, candidates are expected to be:  
\- Highly motivated and self-sufficient,  
\- Willing to learn, pay attention to detail,  
\- With a good level of English (both oral and written).
