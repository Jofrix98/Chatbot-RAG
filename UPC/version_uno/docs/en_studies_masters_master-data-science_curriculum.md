The curriculum of the FIB Master's Degree in Data Science (MDS) was [approved
by the School
Board](/sites/fib/files/documents/actes/acords_jf_2020-07-01_mod_1.pdf) on 1
July 2020. It is adapted to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and has
a 120 ECTS credits:

  * 54 compulsory credits
  * 36 elective credits
  * 30 credits of Master's Thesis

### Curriculum structure

The University Master's Degree in Data Science from the UPC is structured in 4
semesters. The first semester covers 30 compulsory ECTS; the second semester
covers the remaining 24 compulsory ECTS and 6 elective ECTS; the third
semester must cover the remaining 30 optional ECTS. The fourth and final
semester is fully devoted to the master thesis.

Thus, the compulsory training requires 54 ECTS (equivalent to 9 subjects of 6
ECTS) divided into 3 fields:

  * Data Science Fundamentals (12 ECTS): Statistical Inference and Modeling (SIM), and Algorithmics, Data Structures and Databases (ADSDB). 
  * Data management (18 ECTS): Data Warehousing (DW), Big Data Management (BDM) and Semantic Data Management (SDM).
  * Data analytics (24 ECTS): Multivariate Analysis (MVA), Process-oriented Data Science (PODS), Machine Learning (ML) and Mining Unstructured Data (MUD).

The following is the presentation of the structure of the master's study plan:

### Elective Courses

The elective training is structured in 36 ECTS. The 36 ECTS must be completed
from the following offered tracks:

  * Deep Dive in Specific Aspects of Data Science
  * Applications of Data Science for Specific Domains
  * Innovation and Research

The _deep dive in specific aspects of Data Science_ track deepens in advanced
aspects of data management and data analysis. The _applications of Data
Science for specific domains_ track focuses on Data Science techniques
specific for popular domains of application, which require specific pre-
processing, management and analysis of specific data. The deep dive track is
meant to get specialized in advanced techniques, while the applications track
is meant to get specialized in specific domains. Finally, the _Innovation and
Research_ track delves into the connection of Data Science with business
innovation and research. Courses in the innovation and research track focuses
on fostering the required traversal skills to meet the high level of
innovation necessary in the professional field of Data Science.

Students can choose courses from the abovementioned tracks to fulfill the
elective training. However, the following maximum of ECTS per track is set:

  * 24 ECTS on the applications of Data Science for specific domains track,
  * 15 ECTS on the innovation and research track,
  * 36 ECTS on the Deep Dive in specific aspects of Data Science (no limit).
