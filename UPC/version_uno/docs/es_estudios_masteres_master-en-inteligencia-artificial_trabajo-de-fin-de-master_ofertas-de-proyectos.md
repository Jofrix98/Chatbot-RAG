Descripción

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging
technique that measures changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated
hemoglobin (HbR) in the cerebral cortex. Due to its portability and low cost,
fNIRS has been used in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications,
characterizing hemodynamic responses to varying stimuli, and investigating
auditory and visual-spatial attention during Complex Scene Analysis (CSA). In
this project, we want to design and implement an fNIRS study with a goal of
studying the impact of neural and BCI outcomes to improving the training of
LAI models' attention mechanism (e.g., Transformer attention) during reading
comprehension tasks (e.g., the participants will be judging the quality of
generated text). We want to demonstrate experimentally that augmenting a model
with fNIRS data carries neural activity features complementing the information
captured by the model and demonstrate that it improves the models'
performance. To this end, we will have to collect data from participants and
test how different Transformer models benefit from different types of fNIRS
attention masks.

The candidate will:

  * Carry out controlled studies and collect data from a number of participants.
  * Try different approaches to incorporating fNIRS signal in the training process of DL/LLM models and compare against baselines/experiments (these should be replicated).
  * Carry out ablation studies, personalisation techniques, error analyses, etc.
  * Contribute to authoring a scientific article

Measurement on Mobile Devices

data acquired by mobile device cameras, to track and quantify visual

Descripción

Automatic gaze tracking methods have been used in the recent years for various
purposes, including measuring ad attention or enabling for gesture-less user-
device interactions. Most of these methods have been tested in the desktop
setting, while the few reported attempts that addressed the mobile setting
report low accuracy and require continuous calibration. Additionally, the
aforementioned methods rely on expensive sensors, such as infrared eye
trackers, that limit their scaling capacity. Other methods employ touch-based
interactions (e.g., tracking zoom/pinch gestures and scroll activity) to
produce an estimation of the user gaze which, at best, are weakly correlated
with visual attention. However, 42% of the time spent on websites is by mobile
users, while similar trends are reported for the percentage of page views per
visit, which creates an opportunity for a novel attention measurement
technology to take root; one which can offer accurate, reliable, and scalable
measurements.

In the proposed project, we are interested in the mobile setting, and propose
the use of depth information, on top of the usual RGB (Red, Green, Blue) pixel
data acquired by mobile device cameras, to track and quantify visual
attention. Depth information can either be estimated with post computer visual
processing or acquired directly with high precision, using advanced LiDAR
sensors that newer smartphone models are currently equipped with. Furthermore,
we propose the use of "lightweight" Deep Learning (DL) techniques to achieve
an accurate and robust gaze point estimation without the need of extensive
calibration. Unlike prior art, we will consider the use of historical
information to inform future predictions and will examine how such models can
be tailored to each user by injecting personalized data. In addition, we
propose a more lightweight Neural Network (NN) architecture, suitable for the
processing power of mobile devices, that also leverages the use of video or
photo frames with depth sensory data.

The candidate will:

  * Develop an app for iPhone (in Swift) for collecting gaze information and image data (using the device's frontal camera and LiDAR sensors), while completing a simple task of tracking a red dot in a matrix.
  * Incorporate in the app the functionality offered by SensingKit, an open-source mobile sensing framework compatible with iOS specialised in capturing motion, orientation, location and proximity (using iBeacon¿ or Eddystone¿) data and transmitting them on a server over any Internet connection. [<https://github.com/SensingKit/SensingKit-iOS>]
  * Carry out a crowdsourcing study and collect data from a number of participants.
  * Train lightweight DL models to predict accurately gaze point estimation, using the collected data, and compare against prior baselines/experiments (these should be replicated).
  * Carry out ablation studies, personalisation techniques, error analyses, etc.
  * Contribute to authoring a scientific article

Recent advancements in nanotechnology have enabled the development of means
for sensing and wireless communications with unprecedented miniaturization and
capabilities, to the point that they can be introduced into the
gastrointestinal tract inside a pill or into the bloodstream in the form of
passively flowing nanomachines.

This opens the door to the idea of intra-body communication networks, this is,
a swarm of nanosensors inside the human body that use communications to
coordinate their actions to sense and localize specific events (lack of
oxygen, biomarkers, etc). This can lead to the development of applications
such as continuous monitoring of diabetes, detection and localization of
cancer micro-tumors, or early detection of blood clots. These possibilities
are currently investigated by our team at the N3Cat (www.n3cat.upc.edu).

In this context, we are looking for excellent and self-motivated individuals
who are eager to work on developing AI schemes (based on graph neural networks
or multi-agent RL) for the detection and localization of events inside of the
human body. Data will be gathered with an in-house simulator that integrates
mobility models (BloodVoyagerS) and communication models (TeraSim).

Descripción

The overall goal is to reduce the emissions of a commercial light-duty vehicle
with a disruptive new ICE powertrain concept of a pre-turbine EAT combined
with a power split hybridization. Because of the disruptive concept, a new
operating strategy of the hybrid powertrain is necessary. To develop this
operating strategy, an innovative AI-based approach in the form of a
Reinforcement Learning agent is followed. To train this agent, a very large
amount of training data is generated by means of an innovative, AI-based
simulation environment. The methodology provides a tool that helps to assess
the quality of a conventionally developed operating strategy. Work is
developed in collaboration with IFS University Stuttgart and FZA TU Berlin.

Having into consideration all the different elements in the process as well as
the models developed, this project deals with the control design and tuning,
following these steps:

(1) Since models exist, a model-based predictive control approach is
considered as a basis.

(2) In the next step, the control is developed by model-based reinforcement
learning. The advantage of the RL approach is that it works better for systems
with complex dynamics and unstructured behaviour. In this case, the fitness
function is easily defined using the values from the calculated emissions.
Actions being implemented by the controller is a matter of study, as well as
the working points. Besides, links between RL and stochastic optimal control
can also be explored working only on the provided data.

(3) Optionally, the programming can be oriented to parallel computing to take
advantage of multi-processor hardware to accelerate further the use of the
final tool. In this sense, during the project a HPC UPC cluster will be
available for the computing, in order to optimize and verify the final
performance.

Descripción

LABINQUIRY project aims to develop a didactic infrastructure to help secondary
school and university teachers to implement inquiry-based learning processes
called study and research paths (SRPs). The starting point of an SRP is an
open question that students address in small groups with the help of the
teacher, they have to search for data, information, new tools and knowledge,
etc, study them and jointly elaborate a single answer of the whole class.

One difficulty posed by the SRPs in terms of management is the teacher's
treatment of the weekly reports produced by the student groups with the
partial results of the work done during the week. The teacher responsible for
the SRP has to "process" these reports in limited time in order to prepare the
next class session. In this processing, the teacher has to read the reports -
about 10-12 per class -, compile the most important information and group them
according to the type of questions raised by each team, the data collected,
the interim results provided, and the sources of information used.

The research group responsible for the LABINQUIRY project is interested in
achieving an automatic processing of the content of student reports. The aim
of the TFM would be, from a set of 10-12 reports, to collect and organise the
information contained in the reports to help the teacher organise the next
task. Both the questions posed by the teacher in the SRP and the students'
reports are natural language texts. The collection and organisation of the
information can be done at different levels and from different points of view
(some of which are already fixed but some of which are not), giving
flexibility to the work to be done during the TFM. In principle, the
techniques to be used would fall into the following areas: unsupervised
learning (clustering) and natural language processing (word embeddings).

The expected timing is January-June 2024.

To carry out this project it is advisable to have a good mastery of Spanish
and/or Catalan and the techniques mentioned above.
